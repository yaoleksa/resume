                Van Rossum was born and raised in the Netherlands,
                where he received a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University
                of Amsterdam in 1982. He has a brother, Just van Rossum, who is a type designer and programmer 
                who designed the typeface used in the "Python Powered" logo.[7]
                Van Rossum lives in Belmont, California, with his wife, Kim Knapp,[8] and their son.[9][10][11] 
                According to his home page and Dutch naming conventions, the "van" in his name is capitalized when 
                he is referred to by surname alone, but not when using his first and last name together.
